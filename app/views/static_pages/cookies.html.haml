      We use the following types of cookie:

    %dl
      %dt Essential cookies
      %dd

        These are cookies that are required for the operation of our
        website. They include, for example, cookies that enable you to
        log in to secure areas of our website, and access features
        specific to you.

      %dt Analytical cookies
      %dd

        These allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors
        and to see how visitors move around our website when they are
        using it. This helps us to improve the way our website works,
        for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are
        looking for easily.

      %dt Functionality cookies
      %dd

        These are used to recognise you when you return to our
        website. This enables us to personalise our content for you.
        Currently we only use a functionality cookie to record whether
        you have consented to the use of cookies, but in the future we
        may use more to do things such as greet you by name and
        remember your preferences (for example, your choice of
        language or region).
