    %h1 About Swap My Vote

      Wasted votes are a massive problem in UK general elections -

                "https://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/latest-news-and-research/publications/the-2017-general-election-report/",

      and eleven seats were decided by fewer than 100 votes. Our
      broken electoral system polarises the national debate, and leads
      to divisions in the very society it is supposed to represent.

      In 2015, only a quarter of votes cast were necessary for the
      candidates to win; 50% of votes were for losing candidates and
      received no direct representation in Parliament. Parties throw
      resources at marginal constituencies while neglecting safe seats
      and all kinds of consequences follow including voter apathy, low
      turnout, electoral deserts, and the need for tactical voting,
      amongst other problems.

      Electoral reform is long overdue; 2011’s AV referendum did
      nothing to correct any of these issues.

      Referendums in 2014 and 2016 on Scottish Independence and EU
      membership strongly indicated how popular voting can be when
      voters know that it will count. As did the

      The Internet has opened up previously undreamed-of ways for
      people to collaborate and share resources. Swap My Vote aims to
      bring some of the best aspects of the ‘Sharing Economy’ to the
      very workings of democracy. A radical and practical experiment,
      Swap My Vote uses social media to help pair voters who want to
      swap, each casting each other’s preferred vote where it could
      count for more.
