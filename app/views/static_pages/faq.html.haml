    %h1 FAQ

    %a(name="legal")
    %h2 Is this legal?
    %p Yes.
    %p

      Vote swapping has taken place informally since voting began, not
      least within parliaments. We know of no law against it (unlike
      selling your vote, or compelling someone to vote against their
      will, which are very much illegal!), and indeed in the USA,
      swapping votes has <a
      href="https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2007/08/06/0655517.pdf">been
      found</a> by the Appeals Court to be <a
      href="https://www.wired.com/2007/08/internet-vote-s/">protected
      speech</a> under the First Amendment.

      Swap My Vote merely introduces two individuals to each other who
      have the relevant voting preferences; nothing changes hands, and
      the secret ballot still stands: you are responsible for trusting
      your partner - and voting according to your conscience!

    %a(name="trust")
    %h2 How do I know my partner will vote (for who I want)?
    %p

      We have integrated the Swap My Vote platform with two of the
      biggest public social networks used in the UK so that you see
      that there is a real person at the other end of the swap, and
      potentially make contact with your partner. The kinds of
      thoughts and articles you share may help trust arise
      naturally. If you do make contact, perhaps let each other know
      what the most important policies to you, what you would like
      your vote to achieve, why you have decided to swap your
      vote. Some people even let each other know when they're heading
      down to the ballot and, on the day, there'll be a button you can
      use to automatically let each other know you've voted. We’re
      hoping that this site may contribute to a greater sense of
      community amongst voters, all hoping to make the country run as
      well as possible for a better future.

    %a(name="privacy")
    %h2 Do my voting intentions stay private?
    %p

      Yes. Your voting intentions are sacred!

      We do not publish anything on your behalf outside the Swap My Vote platform.

      Sharing the site is voluntary and the 'share' buttons create a
      draft post with generic text which you can change before
      posting.

      No data is shared with Facebook or Twitter about your voting
      preferences.

      We only collect the minimum of data to allow us to find you a
      swap - see our

      = link_to "privacy policy",
                "http://www.swapmyvote.uk/privacy"

      for more about how we use cookies to monitor visits to the site.

    Your name, profile picture, constituency and voting preferences will be presented to voting partners in different constituencies who have the complementary preferences.

    %a(name="login")
    %h2 Why do I need to log in with Facebook or Twitter and not email or (X)?

    %p We are trying to bring an element of trust to vote swapping (see above) - in order that your voting partner can have a sense of who you are, and vice versa, we currently ask that you log in with one of the two biggest public social networks used in the UK, Twitter and Facebook. This way you can see who each other are, and what kinds of issues are important to one another, and even get in contact, forming a mini-alliance. We are actively looking at further options for the 2019 UK General Election and future elections.

    %a(name="trouble")
    %h2 I'm having trouble logging in - help!
    If you are having issues logging in, please check you are not using any browser extensions that may block data from Facebook or Twitter (like Adblock).

    %a(name="parties")
    %h2 How have you chosen which political parties to offer through Swap My Vote?
    %p Working out which parties to include in the swapmyvote.uk platform has not been straightforward: initially we prioritised parties that were fielding candidates in all constituencies across the UK. Then, particularly in the wake of 2015's Leaders Debates, which uncovered hidden demand for Scottish and Welsh parties, we added SNP and Plaid Cymru. Inclusion in the platform is currently a trade-off between simplicity and the time it takes to include parties; updating poll information is time-consuming and we are at present a small team. Lastly, with the phenomenal demand for the platform, we have been working hard to make sure that other aspects of the site work as well as possible. Ultimately, Swap My Vote is devotedly non-partisan and aspires to as fully inclusive as practically possible - thank you for bearing with us while we work towards this.

    %a(name="constituencies")
    %h2 I want to swap with someone in a particular constituency. Please can you find me a swap there?
    %p At present we show you potential voting partners in a range of constituencies in order to maximise the number of swaps available to everyone who has signed up. You can see polls by their names and, if you can't find a swap you are happy with, you can reset your voting preferences and be matched again (see below).

    %a(name="reset")
    %h2 My swap hasn't been confirmed. How can I reset or cancel my swap?
    %p If your partner hasn't confirmed the swap, it will now automatically cancel after #{swap_validity_hours} hours and we will email both parties to let them know to log in to find a new partner.

    If you have changed your voting preferences or moved constituency (or if you would like to change partner) you can just update your info using the link that says "Not right? Update your info" and it will reset the swap, letting your partner know it has been cancelled.

    %a(name="better")
    %h2 The swap I’ve been offered isn’t a good one - how can I find a better voting partner?
    %p You can just update your info using the link that says "Not right? Update your info" and it will reset the swap, letting your partner know it has been cancelled. You are then free to select another voting partner from the list.

    %a(name="noone")
    %h2 No-one is confirming a swap with me. What’s going on?
    %p People finding it hard to find a swap are often in quite safe seats - you may find it useful to think about experimenting with your 'willing' party - you can update your info using the link that says "Not right? Update your info" and we will try to find you new voting partners based on the new details.

    %a(name="deactivate")
    %h2 I have changed my mind and no longer wish to find someone to swap with. What should I do?
    %p

      You can deactivate your account by changing both of your party
      preferences to the same party

      = link_to("here", edit_user_path) + ","

      so that a swap becomes meaningless and no-one is likely to
      suggest one.

    %p
      You can

      = link_to("permanently remove your account",
                confirm_account_deletion_path) + "."

      Please note that you will no longer get emails from us with news
      on electoral reform or reminders for future elections.
