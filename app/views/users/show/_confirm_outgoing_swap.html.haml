  You've asked to swap your vote with #{@user.swapped_with.redacted_name}!

%p
  .card.profile
    = render partial: "user/swaps/swap_profile", object: @user.swapped_with, as: "other_user"

%p.text-center
  %i.fa.fa-fw.fa-hourglass-half
  We're just waiting for #{@user.swapped_with.redacted_name} to confirm the
  swap!

  - if @user.email.blank?

    Keep checking back here, or
    = link_to("set an email address", edit_user_path)
    so that we can keep you posted.

  - else

    When they do we'll send you an email.

%p.text-center

  If we don't hear back from them in #{swap_validity_hours} hours,
  we'll cancel the swap and you can pick someone else.

%h3.text-center
  In the meantime ...

  Why not spread the word to encourage more people to join?
