	Hi #{@user.name},
%p
	I'm sorry to say that your swap with #{@swap_with.name} has been cancelled.
	This could have happened if you or #{@swap_with.name} changed preferred parties, moved constituency,
	declined the swap, or (most likely!) if the swap expired before being confirmed.

	Don't delay!
%p
	All the best,
