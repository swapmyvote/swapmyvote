  Hi #{@user.name},
%p
  The 2019 General Election polls have just opened, but I'm afraid we haven't been able to confirm your pending swap with #{@user.swapped_with.redacted_name}.
  All is not lost though - you can still vote tactically, or for the party you most wish to support.

  Thank you for taking part - together we are making democracy better and more representative.

  All the best,
