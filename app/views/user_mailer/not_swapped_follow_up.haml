	Hi #{@user.name},
%p
	Thanks for taking part in Swap My Vote! Votes for #{@user.willing_party.name}
	are in high demand; wanting to cast a vote
	elsewhere for the #{@user.preferred_party.name} party means that you should
	have plenty of choice for potential voting partners to make sure that your
	vote is cast where it will count the most for you.

	If you've not been able to find someone that you're willing to swap with,
	then please reply to this email and let us know why. Hopefully we can improve
	the system so that we can find as many suitable swaps as possible!

	All the best,
