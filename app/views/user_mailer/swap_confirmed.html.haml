	Hi #{@user.name},
%p
	You're all set to swap your vote with
	= user_profile_link(@swap_with) + "!"
	#{@swap_with.name} is going to vote for the #{@swap_with.willing_party.name} party for you, in the #{@swap_with.constituency.name} constituency.
	In return, you will vote for the #{@swap_with.preferred_party.name} party in your constituency (#{@user.constituency.name}).
%p
	We'll send some reminders to #{@swap_with.name} to remind them to vote for your chosen party on December 12th, and we'll ask them for confirmation once they have.

	- if @swap_with.profile_url.present?
		In the meantime, why not
		%a{href: @swap_with.profile_url} reach out to #{@swap_with.name} directly?

%p
	Lastly, why not share Swap My Vote with your social networks so that more people can make their vote count?
