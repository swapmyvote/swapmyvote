require "csv"

# This is an encapsulation of the CSV which maps "old" constituency
# names (e.g. in table presently named "constituencies", now redundant)
# to the ONS ids used in the "new" constituency table
# (presently named "ons_constituencies")
# The csv is currently found at
# db/fixtures/constituency_original_names_with_ons_ids.csv
# It was derived partly programmatically, and partly manually.

# It can't be downloaded from anywhere, and it is crucial to being
# able to relate the constituency names used in the electoral calculus
# poll predictions to ONS constituency ids used eleswhere.
